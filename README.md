# Monte Carlo Methods for Option Pricing

Monte Carlo methods are a variety techniques used for random sampling all the way to computing integrals, with the underlying concecpt of using random sampling and simulations to obtain results. These methods have a wide variety of applications but we will focus on its application in finance, in our scenario we will be calculating option prices. This notebook will walk through and explore this method of pricing options drawing material learnt from my univeristy courses in Stochastic Simulation and Partial Differential Equations.
